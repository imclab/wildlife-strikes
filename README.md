For our SI 649 final group project at the University of Michigan School of Information, we designed an interactive 
visualization mapping incidents of wildlife strikes on aircraft from 1999 to 2012 based on data from the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA). We chose the FAA animal strikes dataset because, besides being quite large, there were many interesting 
stories that we hoped users would uncover through their interactions with the visualization. By integrating several dimensions of 
the data -- notably time, location, and animal type -- we allow users to explore relationships between these dimensions and discover 
fascinating details about individual wildlife strike incidents.
